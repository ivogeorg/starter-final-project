# CPE 1040 - Introduction to Computer Engineering

## Assignment: Final Project

### Criteria for micro:bit JS programs

#### General requirements
1. The (README)[README.md] should contain:
   1. Well formatted contents. Use the [Github Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
   2. The names of collaborators. **Note: Each team mate should have their own individual submission.**
   3. Any roles, that is, who did what.
2. Micro:bit programs should have source file names with the `.js` file extension.
3. Each micro:bit program source file should have a short leading comment with:
   1. File name.
   2. Short description of the program.
   3. Name of authors.
   4. Date of last modification.
4. All separate tasks should have a short writeup in the [README](README.md) file, containing a link to the corresponding source code file.

#### Code quality
1. The program should have proper indentation.
2. Every block of code should contain inline comments, briefly describing its purpose and functionality.	
3. The program should have good structure, with asynchronous and synchronous code blocks properly differentiated.
4. Variables should be named in either of the following styles:
   1. `variable_name_of_underscore_delimited_lower_case_words`, or
   2. `variableNameInCamelCase`

#### JavaScript
1. Variables, including arrays, should be declared with [full static data types](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/types).	
2. Programmatic functionality should be encapsulated in [functions](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/functions), and, optionally for **bonus** points, [classes](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/classes).	
3. Functions in JavaScript are [1st class objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function). All event constructs like `onButtonPressed` and `onGesture` take functions as arguments.	
4. A maximum variety of JS language constructs (loops, conditionals, various operators, encapsulations, event handling, etc) should be used.

#### micro:bit			
1. Use of buttons	and/or guestures.
2. Sensible display update.
3. Non-trivial functionality.	
4. Control complexity.
5. Good use of pins for external I/O.

#### Videos
1. Each separate task should have an accompanying demo video.
2. Videos should be no longer than 30 seconds.
3. Links to the videos should be embedded in the short task writeups.
